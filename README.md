## Description

The aim of this project is to create a webpage to display a new portfolio of the different websites which I have built during the Bootcamp. The new portfolio will be built using Bootstrap code.

The following acceptance criteria was set for by the Bootcamp team for my portfolio webpage :

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The website should include the following bootstrap components:

    - A Navigation bar
    - A navigation menu at the top. Feel free to use the navbar code provided in Bootstrap's documentation, or create your own navbar by applying the correct Bootstrap classes to your HTML.
      - Include links that are applicable to your portfolio.
        - Links should navigate to the appropriate sections 

    - A hero section
        - A jumbotron featuring your picture, your name, and any other information you'd like to include.

    - A work section
      - A section displaying your work in grid. 
        - If you need to use placeholder image use: https://placehold.co/ 
      - Use bootstrap cards for each project.
        - The description should give a brief overview of the work.
      - Each project will eventually link to your class project work!

    - A skills section
      - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.

    - An about / contact section.
      - An "About Me" section in the same row.
    
    - A footer section.
      - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
      - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

    Your Bootstrap solution should minimize use of media queries.

During the process of working on this project I have learned more about the fundamentals of structured HTML and CSS coding, including the use of Flex boxes and images. 

I have also learned about Bootstrap code.

Furthermore, I have become a little more familiar with working with GitHub and ReadMe files.


## Installation

Open the following webpage from any internet browser.

![Challenge 3 - link to Steve Hannay Portfolio page](https://stevehannay.github.io/Console-Finances/)

No installation is necessary. 


## Usage

This is a very simple webpage to use.

The top navigation panel provides navigation to the About Me, Work and Contact Details sections of the webpage.

The screenshots of the webpages displayed (the ones that I have already created) are clickable, so that the user can naviagate to them.

The Contacts section contains clickable links to LinkedIn and GitHub.


Here are screenshots of the webpage created for the project.
