# Challenge 4 - Console-Finance

Challenge homework : 
Challenge 4 - Project for 04-javascript-module 
Task - Create code for analyzing the financial records of a company from a financial dataset 

Developer - Steve Hannay
Completed - 2nd Jan 2024


## Description

The aim of this project is to create a webpage where the Console displays the results of the analysis.

The following acceptance criteria was set for by the project :

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

    * The total number of months included in the dataset.

    * The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

    * The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
        * Track what the total change in Profit/Losses are from month to month and then find the average.
    * (`Total/(Number of months - 1)`)

    * The greatest increase in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

    * The greatest decrease in Profit/Losses (date and difference in the amounts) over the entire period.

    When openning the code in the browser the resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

    ```text
    Financial Analysis 
    ----------------
    Total Months: 86
    Total: $38382578
    Average Change: -2315.12
    Greatest Increase in Profits/Losses: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
    Greatest Decrease in Profits/Losses: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
    ```

During the process of working on this project I have learned more about the fundamentals of javascript coding, including the use of arrays, loops and conditional statements. 

Furthermore, I have become a little more familiar with working with GitHub and ReadMe files.


## Installation
